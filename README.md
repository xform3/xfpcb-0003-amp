# XFPCB-0003 Class-AB Amplifier 30W

## Variation 1 LM1875
The LM1875 is a monolithic power amplifier offering very low distortion and high quality performance for consumer audio applications.

### Specifications 
- Load: 4Ω - 8Ω 
- Output Power: 30W
- Power Supply Range 12V-36V

### Features
- Low Distortion: 0.015%, 1 kHz, 20 W
- Wide Power Bandwidth: 70 kHz
- High Current Capability: 4A
- Protection for AC and DC Short Circuits to Ground

## Variation 2 TDA2030


Resistance: 4Ω-8Ω

Potput Power: 10-30W

The TDA2030 is a monolithic integrated circuit in
Pentawatt package, intended for use as a low
frequency class AB amplifier. Typically it provides
14W output power (d = 0.5%) at 14V/4Ω; at ± 14V
or 28V, the guaranteed output power is 12W on a
4Ω load and 8W on a 8Ω (DIN45500).
The TDA2030 provideshigh output current and has
very low harmonic and cross-over distortion.
Further the device incorporates an original (and
patented) short circuit protection system compris-
ing an arrangement for automatically limiting the
dissipated power so as to keep the working point
of the output transistors within their safe operating
area. A conventional thermal shut-down system is
also included.




Input Voltage 12-16VDC Per Rail | 24-32VDC Combined 

### Example  Input Voltage:  +18 VDC | 0 VDC | -18 VDC
